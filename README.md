# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would say, within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This way, all tests would be automatic. Moreover, they would only be run when a change is made (i.e. when something is pushed into the repo). The second option is less desirable because we would have to manually run the tests rather than automating the process. The third option is not ideal because it is important to test throughout the development process and not just at the end. 

2. No, I would not use E2E testing. This seems more appropriate for a unit test.
